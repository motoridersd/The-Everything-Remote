Modifications made to the Everything Remote to make it the Ultimate Everything Remote
- Added magnetic pogo pins for charging. Increased length of the remote to 155mm to accomidate the USB-C breakout board and pogo pins.
- Removed one of the hardware pull up resistors and added a voltage divider circuit in its place, still retaining button use but now also accuarate battery metrics
- Removed GPIO15 Button and replaced with a WS2812 LED pixel for notifications (And a built in flash light mode)
- Added "Continuous Press" mode on specific buttons to enable holding volume up or down

## ESP-NOW Example with a different remote

Would be nice to make this work with the Everything Remote for very good battery life

## Conditional Deep Sleep

Prevent it from sleeping based on Home Assistant flags, like when TV is on.
Maybe have it sleep overnight and wake up at times we expect to use it, but can always be woken up with the power button.
Use API to send commands from home assistant, maybe set a flag.

## BLE Presence Detection

Add BLE code to ESPHome Yaml:

```
esp32_ble_beacon:
  type: iBeacon
  uuid: 'generate a random UUID'
  tx_power: -6
  min_interval: 
    milliseconds: 200
  max_interval: 
    milliseconds: 500
```

Increased the min and max interval values because the defaults (100ms according to documentation) were causing WiFi issues. Also reduced the power which is 3 dB by default. The power might have been causing the WiFi issues.

Then added the beacon to Bermuda and now I have a location for the Everything Remote in Home Assistant that can be used in the automations.
